# Input: A dictionary Probabilities, where keys are k-mers and values are the probabilities of these k-mers (which do not necessarily sum up to 1)
# Output: A normalized dictionary where the probability of each k-mer was divided by the sum of all k-mers' probabilities
def Normalize(Probabilities):
    # your code here
    total = sum(Probabilities.values())
    return {k: v/total for k, v in Probabilities.items()}
